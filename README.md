# AI-Trading

AI-Trading — An open-source Reinforcement Learning framework for algorithmic trading (Forex/Crypto/Stocks).
This repository provides a production-ready skeleton, examples, CI/CD, documentation, and contributor guidelines.

// Design decisions for the TradingEnv module (OpenAI Gym–compatible) and their rationale:

1. Inheritance from gym.Env
We inherit directly from gym.Env instead of using pre-built financial environments to:
Ensure maximum compatibility with the latest Gym API (and Gymnasium if needed).
Allow flexible customization for trading-specific features (e.g., custom reward functions, multiple asset handling).
Keep the environment lightweight and transparent for debugging and extensions.
2. Observation Space
Design choice: Continuous observation space (Box) that includes OHLCV and technical indicators.
Reason:
Continuous space allows smooth policy learning for most RL algorithms.
Technical indicators are optional but included as part of the environment state for better representation.
3. Action Space
Design choice: Discrete actions (0 = hold, 1 = buy, 2 = sell) for the initial version.
Reason:
Simplifies the first implementation and is easier to debug.
Many RL algorithms (e.g., DQN) work well with discrete spaces.
Future versions may expand to continuous action space (e.g., position sizing, portfolio allocation).
4. Reward Function
Design choice: Reward = change in portfolio value (realized/unrealized PnL).
Reason:
Directly aligns with trading objectives (profit maximization).
Easy to interpret and extend (e.g., include risk-adjusted returns, drawdown penalties).
5. Done Condition
Design choice: Episode ends when data runs out or max drawdown threshold is hit.
Reason:
Prevents unnecessary continuation in unrealistic conditions.
Provides natural episodic structure for training.
6. Data Handling
Design choice: Use preprocessed historical data (CSV or DataFrame) as input.
Reason:
Decouples data preprocessing from environment logic.
Allows fast iteration and testing with different datasets.
7. Modularity & Extensibility
Design choice: The environment is built as a standalone module (ai_trading/envs/trading_env.py) with clear interfaces.
Reason:
Encourages open-source contributions.
Enables integration with different RL libraries (Stable-Baselines3, RLlib, etc.).
Future-proof: easy to plug into multi-agent or multi-asset frameworks.
